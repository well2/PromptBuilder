# Testing and Optimization for PromptBuilder Frontend

## Testing Implementation

### Testing Setup
- Configured Vitest as the test runner
- Set up React Testing Library for component testing
- Created test utilities for rendering components with providers
- Added mocks for browser APIs (IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver, etc.)

### Component Tests
We've implemented comprehensive tests for the following components:

1. **UI Components**
   - Button: Testing different variants, sizes, loading states, and event handling
   - Input: Testing label rendering, error states, and form interactions
   - Card: Testing layout, title/subtitle rendering, and custom styling

2. **Feature Components**
   - CategoryTree: Testing tree rendering, selection, and expansion/collapse
   - DynamicForm: Testing form generation, validation, and submission

### Utility Tests
- Performance utilities: Testing debounce, throttle, memoize, and performance measurement functions

## Performance Optimizations

### Code Splitting
- Implemented route-based code splitting using React Router
- Set up vendor chunk splitting to separate framework code from application code

### Bundle Optimization
- Configured Vite build for optimal production bundles
- Implemented tree-shaking to eliminate unused code
- Set up compression (gzip and brotli) for smaller file transfers

### Runtime Performance
- Created utility functions for performance-critical operations:
  - Debounce: Prevents excessive function calls
  - Throttle: Limits function execution rate
  - Memoize: Caches expensive function results
  - Performance measurement: Helps identify bottlenecks

### Rendering Optimizations
- Used React.memo for pure components
- Implemented proper key usage in lists
- Optimized re-renders with proper state management

## Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Tested on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Added polyfills for modern JavaScript features
- Used vendor prefixes for CSS properties

## Accessibility Improvements
- Added proper ARIA attributes to interactive elements
- Ensured keyboard navigation works correctly
- Maintained sufficient color contrast for text readability

## Future Improvements
- Implement end-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress
- Set up continuous integration for automated testing
- Add performance monitoring in production
- Implement code coverage reporting
