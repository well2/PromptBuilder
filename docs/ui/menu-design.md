# Menu Design Documentation

## Overview

The navigation menu in PromptBuilder is designed to provide clear and intuitive access to all major features of the application. The menu has been designed with specific visual cues to indicate the importance and nature of different functions.

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity**: Each menu item has a clear icon and label
2. **Hierarchy**: Important functions are visually emphasized
3. **Consistency**: Similar styling patterns are used throughout
4. **Accessibility**: Menu items have sufficient size and contrast

## Menu Items

The menu consists of the following items, in order of appearance:

1. **Generate** - Primary function, highlighted in blue
2. **Home** - Standard navigation item
3. **Categories** - Standard navigation item
4. **Templates** - Standard navigation item
5. **API Provider** - Standard navigation item
6. **Management** - Dangerous functionality, highlighted in red

## Visual Styling

### Standard Menu Items
- Icons positioned before text (horizontally aligned)
- Gray text with blue icons
- Hover effect: Light blue background with blue text

### Primary Function (Generate)
- Blue background with white text
- White icon
- Box shadow for emphasis
- Hover effect: Darker blue with larger shadow

### Dangerous Function (Management)
- Red background with white text
- White icon
- Box shadow for emphasis
- Hover effect: Darker red with larger shadow

## Mobile Menu

The mobile menu follows the same visual hierarchy but is displayed vertically when the hamburger menu is clicked:

- Primary function has light blue background with blue text and border
- Dangerous function has light red background with red text and border
- Standard items have white background with hover effects

## Implementation Details

The menu is implemented in `frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` with styling in `frontend/src/index.css`. The implementation uses:

- React Router for navigation
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- HeroIcons for menu icons

## Testing

The menu implementation includes unit tests in `frontend/src/components/layout/__tests__/Header.test.tsx` that verify:

- All menu items are rendered correctly
- Primary and danger styling is applied appropriately
- Mobile menu behavior works as expected

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to the menu could include:

- Active state styling for the current page
- Submenu support for more complex navigation
- Keyboard navigation enhancements
- More extensive animation options
